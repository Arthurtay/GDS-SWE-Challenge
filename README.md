## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a random restaurant finder, utilizing the React JavaScript framework and the Material-UI library for the frontend. The backend is powered by a Java Spring Boot REST API, while using an in-memory H2 database with pre-configured with seeder data within the application.

## How to Run

### Installation

1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed for the React application.
2. Navigate to the ../frontend/restaurant-finder directory and run the following command to install dependencies:
```
  npm install
```


### Running the application

1. To run the API, you can use the following command for the already-built JAR:
```
java -jar GDS-Restaurant-v2.jar
```
Alternatively, if you are running the backend application as a Spring Boot application from your IDE, ensure the backend is ready.

Once the backend is set up, go to the ../frontend/restaurant-finder directory and run the following command to start the react application:
```
  npm start
```

# GDS Restraunt Api Documentation

The API would be hosted in localhost port 9090.

## Configuration

#### CorsConfig

This configuration, CorsConfig, is designed to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Given that the client's location host port can vary, and there is no fixed origin, this configuration allows requests from any origin for the /restaurant/** endpoint. Specifically, only POST requests are permitted, ensuring secure interaction with the API while accommodating a variety of client origins."

```CorsConfig.java
/** 
 * Cross-Origin Configuration
 * */
@Configuration
public class CorsConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/restaurant/**")
                .allowedOrigins("*")
                .allowedMethods("POST"); 
    }
}
```

##### DatabaseSeederConfig
The DatabaseSeederConfig is used to populate the in-memory database. 

```DatabaseSeederConfig.java
/**
 * Configuration to Seed the H2 memory database. 
 * */
@Configuration
public class DatabaseSeederConfig {

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner seedDatabase(RestaurantLocationRepository repository) {
        return args -> {
            List<RestaurantLocation> locations = List.of(
